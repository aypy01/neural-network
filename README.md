# Summary - Traditional ML vs Neural Networks

## ✅ Core Flow (Same for Both)
1. Split data (train/test)
2. Train with features + targets
3. Evaluate using metrics (accuracy, F1, etc.)
4. Predict on unseen data

The pipeline is the same for **traditional ML** and **neural networks**.

## 🔹 Traditional ML
- Works well on **small to medium datasets**.
- Relies on **feature engineering** (human-designed features).
- Algorithms: Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.
- **SVM** can handle nonlinear decision boundaries (via kernels).
- Good for structured/tabular data (banknotes, medical tables, finance).

---

## 🔹 Neural Networks (NN)
- Scale well with **big and complex datasets** (images, audio, text).
- Can automatically **learn feature representations** (e.g., CNN learns edges, shapes, textures).
- Handle **very complex, high-dimensional decision boundaries**.
- Require more **data and compute**.
- Flexible: CNN, RNN, DNN, Transformers, etc.

---

## 🔹 Key Insight
- You **don’t need NN for everything**.  
- Use **traditional ML** for simpler, structured problems with limited data.  
- Use **NN** when:
  - Accuracy demands are high  
  - Data is massive and complex  
  - Features are raw (pixels, words, sound waves)  

---

## 📝 Takeaway
- **Flow is the same** (train → evaluate → predict).  
- The choice depends on **scale, complexity, and feature type**.  
- **Traditional ML** = efficient for smaller structured data.  
- **Neural Networks** = powerful for large-scale, high-dimensional, raw data.
